```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { agentReducer } from './agentReducer';
import { userReducer } from './userReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  agent: agentReducer,
  user: userReducer,
});

export default rootReducer;
```

This code generates the Redux root reducer for the file `frontend/src/redux/reducers.js`. It imports the `combineReducers` function from the `redux` library and combines the individual reducers (`agentReducer` and `userReducer`) into a single root reducer using the `combineReducers` function. The root reducer is then exported as the default export of the module.
